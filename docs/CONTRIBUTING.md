# Contributing

🎉 Thank you for taking the time to contribute to {{project_name}} 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are mostly
guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes
to this document in a pull request.

**Here are four ways you can contribute:**

1. [Spread the word](#spread-the-word)
2. [Report bugs](#report-bugs)
3. [Improve the documentation](#improve-the-documentation)
4. [Resolve issues and implement new features](#resolve-issues-and-features)

## Spread the Word

- The easiest to show your support: **Star {{project_name}}** on GitHub.

- You can bring up {{project_name}} in a conversation at the coffee machine,
  [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://github.com/{{repo_owner}}/{{repo_name}}),
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://github.com/{{repo_owner}}/{{repo_name}}),
  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://github.com/{{repo_owner}}/{{repo_name}}),
  [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://github.com/{{repo_owner}}/{{repo_name}}),
  etc.

- {{project_name}} and how you use it can be a good subject for an article if
  you are into blogging.

## Report Bugs

If you found a bug, thank you for taking the time to report it 🙏

To do so, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/{{repo_owner}}/{{repo_name}}/issues/new) and
give as much information as you can about the bug you found and how to reproduce
it.

If you **know** this is a quick fix, you can apply the labels `good first issue`
and `easy` so new contributors can find it easily to resolve it.

> ⚠️ If you found a vulnerability, please see [our security policy](security.md)

## Improve the Documentation

We welcome improvements to the documentation.

If you want to fix a typo, add a sentence or two, an example, etc., you can open
a pull request directly.

For bigger changes to the documentation, we recommend to discuss it in an issue
before spending any time making huge changes that could be rejected.

## Resolve Bugs and Features

If you are into coding, you can **resolve bugs** or **implement new features**.

New contributors should look for issues
[labelled **good first issue** or **easy**](https://github.com/{{repo_owner}}/{{repo_name}}/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+issue",easy).

> ⚠️ Before you start coding, please **first discuss** the change you wish to
> make by commenting on an existing issue or by
> [opening an issue](https://github.com/{{repo_owner}}/{{repo_name}}/issues/new).
