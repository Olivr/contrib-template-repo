[![alt text](img/gitflow.png "GitHub Flow")](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/githubflow-online.pdf)

Here is the process:

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/{{repo_owner}}/{{repo_name}}/fork)

2. Clone **your** fork on your workstation

3. Most of the time, you will want to create a branch off the `main` branch which should be checked out by default, you can ensure it by running:

   ```sh
   git checkout main
   ```

4. Create a branch named after the feature you're working on

   ```sh
   git switch -c <branch_name>
   ```

5. Write code and tests for your change then commit them to your branch and push them to your repository.

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```

   > How to write a descriptive commit message:
   >
   > - Describe what was done; not the result
   > - Use the active voice
   > - Use the present tense
   > - Capitalize properly
   > - Do not end in a period ‚Äî this is a title/subject
   > - Prefix the subject with its scope

6. Open a pull request against this project

7. Work with the project maintainer(s) to get your pull request reviewed

8. Wait for your pull request to be merged and watch it to answer any questions or make any changes you're asked. You will make these modifications directly on your feature branch.

9. Once it is merged, you can delete your feature branch

   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git branch -d <branch_name>
   git push origin --delete <branch_name>
   ```

### Improve the Documentation

We also welcome improvements to the documentation. If you want to fix a typo, add a sentence or two, an example, etc. we recommend that you open a pull request directly. For bigger changes to the documentation, we recommend to discuss it in an issue before spending any time making huge changes that could be rejected.
